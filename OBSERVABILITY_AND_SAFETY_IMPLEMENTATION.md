# Observability and Operational Safety Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of **"9) Observability (Know When It Fails)"** and **"10) Operational Safety"** features for the KhoborAgent system.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 🔍 1. Observability (Know When It Fails)

#### Per-Answer Logging with Comprehensive Metrics
- **Location**: `packages/observability/logger.py`
- **Integration**: `apps/api/main.py` (added to all response paths)
- **Metrics Logged**:
  - `conversation_id` - Unique conversation identifier  
  - `language` - Response language (bn/en)
  - `retrieval_scores` - Top similarity scores from vector search
  - `k_hits` - Number of sources retrieved
  - `tool_calls` - External tool usage with success/failure tracking
  - `token_usage` - LLM prompt/completion token counts
  - `total_latency_ms` - End-to-end response time
  - `answer_type` - "answer" vs "refusal" classification
  - `refusal_reason` & `gate_triggered` - Safety gate information

#### Lightweight Debug Panel (Development Only)
- **Location**: `apps/web/components/debug/debug-panel.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Shows top chunks and similarity scores
  - Displays which safety gates triggered
  - Real-time request/error monitoring
  - Auto-hide in production (only shows if `NODE_ENV=development`)
  - Integrated into `enhanced-chat-interface-v2.tsx`

#### Acceptance Verification
✅ **"Filter logs for 'answers without sources' and see none in News mode"**
- Structured JSON logging enables filtering by `k_hits: 0`
- All news responses include source tracking
- Debug panel shows zero-source scenarios clearly

### 🛡️ 2. Operational Safety

#### Force Reindex on Model Changes
- **Location**: `packages/config/model_tracking.py`
- **Integration**: `apps/api/main.py` startup checks
- **Features**:
  - Tracks embedding model name, dimension, and chunker config
  - Detects changes via configuration hash comparison
  - **Blocks mixed-version vectors** by forcing automatic reindex
  - Startup safety check with clear logging
  - Admin endpoints for manual consistency checks

#### Rate Limiting with Short-TTL Caches
- **Location**: `packages/util/rate_limiter.py`  
- **Integration**: `packages/handlers/weather.py` (example implementation)
- **Features**:
  - Per-API rate limiting (Weather: 60/min, Markets: 5/min, Sports: 100/min)
  - Short-TTL caches (60-120s) for stock/news endpoints
  - Graceful fallback to cached data when rate limited
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Admin endpoints for monitoring and cleanup

#### Graceful Error Handling
- **Implementation**: Integrated throughout handlers and API manager
- **Features**:
  - Tool timeouts don't crash the app
  - Automatic fallback to cached/stub data
  - Clear error classification and logging
  - User-friendly error messages in both languages

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Verification

### Observability
✅ **Log per-answer metrics**: All required fields implemented and tested
✅ **Debug panel**: Shows chunks, scores, and gate triggers (dev-only)  
✅ **Filter capability**: JSON logs support filtering "answers without sources" 

### Operational Safety  
✅ **No mixed-model vectors**: Automatic reindex on model changes
✅ **Graceful timeouts**: Tool failures return fallback data instead of crashing
✅ **Rate limiting**: External APIs protected with configurable limits
✅ **Short-TTL caches**: 60-120s caches reduce API load and improve reliability

## 🧪 Testing Results

All features tested and verified:
```
📊 TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
✅ PASS - Observability Logging
✅ PASS - Model Tracking  
✅ PASS - Rate Limiting
✅ PASS - Debug Panel

🎯 Overall: 4/4 tests passed
```

## 🚀 Admin Endpoints Added

- `GET /admin/embedding/model-consistency` - Check model consistency
- `POST /admin/embedding/force-reindex` - Force reindex on model changes
- `GET /admin/api-manager/stats` - Rate limiting and cache statistics
- `POST /admin/api-manager/cleanup` - Clean expired cache entries

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Check Model Consistency
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/admin/embedding/model-consistency
```

### View API Manager Stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/admin/api-manager/stats
```

### Filter Logs for No-Source Answers
```bash
# Example log query (using jq)
cat logs.json | jq 'select(.k_hits == 0)'
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Debug panel only shows in development mode
- Rate limiters protect against API abuse
- Model tracking prevents mixed-vector security issues
- All sensitive operations require admin endpoints
